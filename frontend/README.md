## Template
The Frontend used the [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) as a template to start our project

## Deployment
1. install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/), newest LTS version is preferred
2. install all the node modules by running `npm install`
3. start the react app by running `npm start`
4. the app will be hosted at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Troubleshooting
1. If any issues occured during step 2 or 3 above, try upgrading node to the newest version
3. Use a modern browser like Chrome or Edge to access the application
2. Sometimes the application may take a while to load when you first open it, just give some time for it to load and it should be smooth afterwards
